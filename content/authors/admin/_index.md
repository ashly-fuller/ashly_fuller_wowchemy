> "It is easy to oversimplify history. However, if there is one predominant factor underlying economic and social change over the past two centuries, it is surely the advancement of technology." Carl Benedikt Frey

I am a first year PhD student at the Dawes Centre for Future Crime based within the Department of Security and Crime Science at UCL.

My research interest lies at the intersection of Technology and Social Policy. I have always been driven to integrate topics of data and technology within core social science disciplines, reflecting my enthusiasm in linking qualitative and quantitative paradigms.

Previously, I researched the relationships between innovative technologies such as cryptocurrency or blockchain and public trust in charities or examined the effects of EU policies on digital inequality.
My PhD project will aim to study the commercialisation of illicit substances to children on social media and its consequences for policy and law enforcement.
